jQuery AS3 Webcam, you will be able to make JPEG captures of web camera, all interactions are made thru javascript.
Javascript callback will receive base64 encoded JPEG image from webcamera. Support different webcam resolutions (320x240, 640x480, any).
Adaptive stage scaling (scale to fit actual webcamera resolution set), stage:video scaling 1:1.

IMPORTANT: You must run example on webserver, it will not work by opening example.html in browser straight from filesystem because of flash/flex restrictions.

SWF external interface:
webcam.save() - get base64 encoded JPEG image
webcam.getCameraList() - get list of available cams
webcam.setCamera(i) - set camera, camera index retrieved with getCameraList
webcam.getResolution() - retrieve actual web camera resolution (set width may not equal result width etc)

External triggers on events:
webcam.isClientReady() - you respond to SWF with true (by default) meaning javascript is ready to accept callbacks
webcam.cameraConnected() - camera connected callback from SWF
webcam.noCameraFound() - SWF response that it cannot find any suitable camera
webcam.cameraEnabled() - SWF response when camera tracking is enabled (this is called multiple times, use isCameraEnabled flag)
webcam.cameraDisabled()- SWF response, user denied usage of camera
webcam.swfApiFail()    - Javascript failed to make call to SWF
webcam.debug()         - debug callback used from SWF and can be used from javascript side too
